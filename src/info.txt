The graphs are of 2 types on the most upper defination :
1) directed graph
2) undirected graph

The edges in the directed graph are only uni-directional . while in the undirected graph , all the vertices are bidirectional

In undirected graph , we have the degree , which the number of ingoing or the outgoing edges in the graph
The total of all the degrees is twice the number of edges in the case of the undirected graph

In directed graph  , we have 2 types of degrees , this are indegree and outdegree
Indegree is the total edges going inside the node
Outdegree is the total edges going outside the node

The path is the sequence of continuous nodes in which all the nodes appears only once .
In the case of the directed graph , the path must have the nodes connected in one direction


Cyclic graph is the graph which has the cycle in it .
In the case of the directed graph , the cycle is seen through the nodes which have the edges in one direction and do not change direction
If such a cycle is not present , then the graph in the case of directed graph is called as the acyclic graph .

When the edges also has some weight associated with it , it is called as the weighted graph
