The disjoint sets are used to solve the problems like finding the component which a particular vertices belong to . This data structure is used to majorly perform 2 operations
find parent and doing union of the two nodes

The implementation of this data structure is done by the union of rank and path compression

path compression means decreasing the path from the node to the main parent and directly connecting the node to the main parent

union helps us identify whether which node is to connected to which node

The time complexity of the both operations is found out to be o(constant)

The space complexity will be o(v) as we are using the rank array for storing the elements
