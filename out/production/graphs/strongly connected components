The strongly connected components are the components which have the nodes placed in such a way that we can travel from any node to the other node in that node

The strongly connected components are the components of the directed graph which satisfy such a type of property .

Even the single nodes in the directed graph can be the strongly connected components if it is not possible to go to the other nodes from that node


We get the strongly connected components of the graph using the kosaraju's algorithm :
1) we first get the stack which contains the components in the topological sort manner , (topological sort using dfs)
2) we will then change the directions of each node of the graph , that is , we will transpose the graph , this will make sure that the nodes are travelled only in the strongly connected graph in the dfs
3) then we will perform the dfs and store the nodes in the arraylist which will have the strongly connected components together
